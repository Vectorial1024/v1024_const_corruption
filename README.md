# v1024_const_corruption
More black market traders ("shadyguys") are spawned gradually.

Eventually, at least 25% of all stations in the galaxy has a black market trader. This state will take a long time to be reached.

Mod activates when the universe is at least 8 hours old; after activation, black market traders will be checked at 1 hour intervals.
